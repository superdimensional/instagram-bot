"outlookEmail.py" makes emails and prints the output to file "botEmails.txt".
"accCred.py" is just a module I have created to generate usernames, passwords, and emails.
It also contains the function to write <email>:<password> combos.
"createAcc.py" creates instagram accounts.
"insta.py" takes the accounts created and signs into them and does an action in instagram.
